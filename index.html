					<p>In this <b>SQL</b> project I am displaying a thorough analysis of the past 4 years
						of company's growth to secure the next round of funding. I am using <b>MySQL</b> Workbench to
						extract
						the data from marketing channel activities and the website improvements that
						have contributed to the success of the company. I have analyzed Key Performance Indicators such
						as:
						the growth of specific channels, showing the overall session-to-order conversion rate trends,
						monthly trending for revenue and margin by product, total sales and revenue. The impact of
						introducing a
						new product and the effects it has on cross-sells of products with eachother by looking at the
						sales data.

					<p> The data that I am using is from the Drilling Operations which is available online.
						Feature values in this dataset are very carefully collected throughout the whole Drilling
						process
						and are quite indicative of the firmness of the formations being drilled.
						I have used this data to create a <b>Machine Learning</b> model
						that will help me to predict a <b>Rock Formation</b> during drilling operations. After selecting
						the features with no redundant values except for <b>Weight on the Drill Bit</b>,as it is one of
						the most important features that can tell us a lot about the Lithology around us,I have removed
						the
						<b>Outliers</b> from this column and prepared the data to be used for the Lithology prediction.
						This model can be very helpful in improving the drilling process as well as being helpful in
						terms of time and cost efficiency.

					<p> This project is about Hyundai Heavy Industries building new ships for customers and they need to
						make a calculated approach to predict how many crew members the ships will need. I used a
						<b>Linear Regression</b> model that will help to predict the number of crew members needed to
						maintain the ships. It was mentioned that particular cruise lines can differ in acceptance
						to the crew counts. So I have decided to include this feature into my analysis. I have used a
						<b>Linear Regression</b> model from <b>PySpark</b> to vectorize the feature values and use it as
						input
						for the model. After looking at the results we can see that many features in the data are
						pretty indicative of the target column which is the number of crew members required for a cruise
						ship.

					<p>For increasing growth and productivity of crop fields,farmers need automatic monitoring for
						plant diseases instead of manually approaching the matter. As naked eye observation is an old
						method that
						requires
						more time for
						disease recognition and also needs an expert making it more time consuming and less effective.
						I have built a <b>Deep Learning</b>, to overcome these disadvantages and used a
						Convolutional Neural Network model
						for image recognition to achieve the detection of plant diseases faster and more accurately. As
						the
						result we have
						38 classes of plants that the leaves belong to. We can also extract the leaves that were
						mistakenly classified
						and improve our model to make it less prone to errors.

					<p>In this <b>Python</b> project we are going deep into the dataset that is about the IoT
						information
						based on the devices used by the customers and the revenue generated by them in USD. I have
						generated new columns
						from the data we already have by calculating the ages of customers from the year of their birth.
						Then I have used Target Encoding
						to replace the categorical values with the average revenue values from the target column so
						our model
						would better understand the inputs. Here in
						this project we
						are using <b>Machine Learning</b> models to make a prediction on the current system status of
						a customer whether
						the system is
						<b>'Active'</b> or <b>'Suspended'</b>

					<p>The aim of the project was to predict the composite index to measure the well-being
						of galaxies based on a number of features in the provided data and based on certain
						contraints optimise their well-being. First after inspecting the data I have started to
						work on the null values to get as much insight from the data as possible. To be able to visually
						make initial
						predictions I have build charts for the <b>Exploratory Data Analysis</b>. The <b>Feature
							Engineering</b> came
						in handy
						when I was selecting the columns with the most significant relationships to our target.
						I have used several <b>Machine Learning</b> models to help me
						in predicting the well-being of galaxies.</p>

						<h2><a href="https://github.com/Ramil124/PortfolioProjects/blob/main/SpaceShip%20Titanic.ipynb"

						<a href="https://github.com/Ramil124/PortfolioProjects/blob/main/SpaceShip%20Titanic.ipynb"
							class="image main" target="_blank"><img src="images/space_ship.jpg" alt=""></a>
						<p>While rounding Alpha Centauri en route to its first destination—the torrid 55 Cancri E—the
							unwary Spaceship Cruise collided with a spacetime anomaly hidden within a dust cloud.
							Sadly, it met a similar fate as its namesake from 1000 years before.
							Though the ship stayed intact, almost half of the passengers were transported to an
							alternate
							dimension! The challenge was to predict which passengers were transported by the anomaly
							using
							records from the spaceship's damaged computer system. Using feature engineering was crucial
							for this dataset to get as much insight as possible. The model
							was responding quite better after I started to use a training dataset with new features.
							Finally I have put all Passenger Id numbers and the predicted results whether they were
							Transported or not into a csv file for easy access.

						<a href="https://github.com/Ramil124/PortfolioProjects/blob/main/House_pricing.ipynb"
							class="image main" target="_blank"><img src="images/house_prices.webp" alt=""></a>
						<p> In this project to predict the Housing Prices I used the dataset from Ames Assessor's Office
							for individual residential properties in Ames, IA. After thoroughly investigating the
							dataset,
							I have started to conduct Data Preprocessing to deal with multiple NaN values in this
							dataset.
							After dropping the features with exceeding null values I have filled the available features
							with
							the appropriate replacements to proceed in my research. I have used multiple Regression
							Machine Learning models, due to the fact that the values we are trying to predict are the
							Continuous Numerical types,
							to make a good prediction for The House Prices based on the training dataset. Lastly I have
							created
							a sample_submission.csv file with ID numbers of houses and their predicted price values
							so it is easier for us to access the results.
